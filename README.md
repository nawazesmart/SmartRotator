## Smart Rotator

A URL rotator website is a platform that allows users to create a single URL that rotates between multiple destination URLs. This can be useful for various purposes such as distributing traffic evenly among multiple websites, conducting A/B testing, or rotating between different affiliate links. Users typically input a list of destination URLs, and when someone visits the rotator URL, they are redirected to one of the destinations based on predefined rules (such as equal distribution or weighted probabilities). This service simplifies the management of multiple URLs and helps optimize online marketing efforts by efficiently distributing traffic.
